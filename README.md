# Stealth Robotics FTC POWERPLAY 2022-2023

This is the repo for all [Stealth Robotics](https://stealthrobotics.org/) FTC code for POWERPLAY.

Stealth Robotics is a robotics team and club based at Cedarcrest High School in Duvall, Washington.
Created in 2012, Stealth has been growing ever since. Comprised of student members and adult
mentors, we aspire to spread STEM throughout our school community and beyond. There are many ways we
accomplish this, including competing in multiple FIRST programs and competitions as well as
outreaching and demonstrating what we do to our local community.

## Teams

Each team has a separate module for their code:

* [AutoPrimeCode](AutoPrimeCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/readme.md)
* [JankbotCode](JankbotCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/readme.md)
* [MishapCode](MishapCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/readme.md)

These are setup with FTCLib to help make coding easier, and Road Runner & OpenCV for autonomous
modes later.

Check out the README.md in each module for details about getting started!

## Sample code and StealthLib

There are bits of sample code in
the [SampleCode](SampleCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/readme.md) module which
might be helpful as you get started. Be sure to also check the standard FTC samples.

`StealthLib` is a library of code which is shared between all the teams.
